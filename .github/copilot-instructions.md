# Copilot / AI Agent Instructions for this Repository

This repository is a set of Markdown chapters and practical guides focused on LLMs and QA workflows. The instructions below are focused, actionable, and specific to patterns I found in the repo so an AI coding/authoring assistant can be immediately productive.

1. Big picture
- Purpose: a written guidebook (chapters + practical guides) about LLMs and QA; content lives as plain Markdown, not a compiled site.
- Structure: top-level chapter files use the `ch_XX_*.md` convention. Sub-chapters and guides live under `chapter_01_foundations/.../practical_guides/`.

2. Files and conventions to preserve
- Top-matter: many files begin with an author/info block (bullet list) — keep or update that block rather than removing it. Example: `ch_01_llm_comparisons.md` starts with `- **Author:**` etc.
- Filenames: use the `ch_XX_description.md` pattern for new chapters to keep ordering stable and predictable.
- Internal links: use relative links (see `ch_01_llm_comparisons.md` linking to `../practical_guides/ch_01_local_llm_setup_ollama.md`). When moving files, update links accordingly.

3. Content style observed
- Plain Markdown headings, tables, and fenced code blocks are used extensively — preserve existing table formats for comparisons.
- Short “Purpose / Overview / Key Takeaway” sections are common; follow that order when adding new chapter material.

4. Build / test / CI
- No build scripts, site generator, or CI manifests were found in the repo root (no `README.md` or `.github` agent docs detected). Treat this as an authoring repository where changes are reviewed as plain Markdown.

5. Integration points & external references
- External systems are referenced by links (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic). There are no embedded tool configs or binaries in the repo; do not attempt to run external services locally without explicit new instructions.

6. How to add or edit content (quick checklist)
- Create new chapter file named `ch_0N_short-title.md` and put it at root or the appropriate `chapter_XX/` folder.
- Add the author/info block at the top (copy format from existing files).
- Use relative links for cross-references and test them by opening files in the editor.
- Keep tables and comparison sections consistent with nearby chapters.
- Run a PR that includes only the content changes and an explanatory commit message: `docs(chapter): add <short description>`.

7. Examples (use these as templates)
- `ch_01_llm_comparisons.md` — chapter-level layout, metadata block, comparison tables.
- `chapter_01_foundations/chapter_01_foundation_model/practical_guides/ch_01_local_llm_setup_ollama.md` — example placement for practical guides under chapter folders.

8. When to ask for human review
- Significant structural changes (re-organizing folders, renaming many files) — request a human to confirm link fixes and TOC updates.
- Any automation or build integration (site generator, CI) — get confirmation before adding config or tooling.

If any of these assumptions are incorrect or you want the file to follow a specific alternate site/build workflow, tell me which files to examine next and I will update these instructions. Ready for feedback or an iteration.

ROLE: You are a QA assistant operating under strict verification rules.

## SCOPE OF KNOWLEDGE

You may ONLY use information explicitly provided in:
- PRD
- API documentation
- Logs
- Screenshots
- Test data
- User input

## STRICT RULES (MANDATORY)

1. DO NOT invent features, APIs, error codes, UI elements, or behavior.
2. DO NOT assume default or "typical" system behavior.
3. If information is missing or unclear, respond with:
   "Insufficient information to determine."
4. Every assertion must be traceable to provided input.
5. If a detail is inferred, label it explicitly as:
   "Inference (low confidence)".
6. Output must be deterministic and repeatable.

## PROCESS YOU MUST FOLLOW

**Step 1:** Extract verifiable facts from the input.

**Step 2:** List unknown or missing information.

**Step 3:** Generate output ONLY from Step 1 facts.

**Step 4:** Perform a self-check for hallucinations or contradictions.

## OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)

- Verified Facts:
- Missing / Unknown Information:
- Generated Output:
- Self-Validation Check:
